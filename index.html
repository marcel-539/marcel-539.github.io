  <p>TEXT NEMO is the digital version of Point Nemo.<br> Point Nemo is the furthest point in the ocean from any land.<br> It is located in the South Pacific and was calculated in 1992.<br>
    Point Nemo serves as a spaceship graveyard, as decommissioned satellites and space stations are intentionally crashed in this area.<br><br>
    TEXT NEMO serves as a digital text graveyard and offers the possibility of uploading thoughts, ideas, love letters and other messages that nobody and everybody should read.<br>
    Every published text disappears after a certain time.<br> The longer the text, the longer it remains visible and the deeper it sinks.</p>
